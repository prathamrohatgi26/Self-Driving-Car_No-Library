# Self Driving Car
## Neural Network using JavaScript with no Libraries

## Overview
This project is a car simulation that utilizes a neural network to control AI-driven cars on a road. The simulation visualizes the cars' movements and their interactions with traffic, allowing for the exploration of AI behavior in a driving context.

## Features
- **AI-Controlled Cars**: The simulation includes AI-driven cars that learn and adapt their driving strategies.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Additional traffic cars are generated dynamically, creating a more realistic driving environment.
- **Neural Network Integration**: The best-performing car's brain is saved and can be reused in future simulations.
- **Visual Representation**: The simulation provides a visual representation of the road, cars, and the neural network.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering graphics
- JavaScript for the simulation logic
- Local Storage for saving the best AI brain

### Usage
- The simulation will start automatically upon loading the page.
- You can observe the AI cars as they navigate the road and interact with traffic.
- The best AI brain will be saved in your browser's local storage, allowing for continued learning in future sessions.

### Customization
- You can modify the number of cars generated by changing the `N` variable in `main.js`.
- Adjust the traffic generation interval in the `animate` function to control how frequently new traffic cars are added.
